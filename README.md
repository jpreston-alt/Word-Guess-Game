# [Word-Guess-Game](https://github.com/jpreston-alt/Word-Guess-Game) 

## Description
This program is a command line word guessing game, essentially like hangman. The user has ten guesses to guess every letter of the blank word correctly. If the user guesses all the letters correctly before their ten turns are over then the program ends. If they do not guess correctly, the correct answer is displayed before the program ends. 

This program is written in JavaScript in Node.js. It uses the random-words npm package to randomly generate the provided word, and inquirer.js to prompt user for their guesses.
